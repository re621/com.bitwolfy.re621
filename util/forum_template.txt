h1. RE621 v.%LATEST_VERSION%

re621 is a comprehensive set of tools and utilities, designed to enhance the website's functionality for both casual and power users.
It overhauls the UI, simplifies uploading and tagging, and allows you to download entire pools, favorites, or simply arbitrary collections of posts.
The project consists of several different modules that improve the entire site, top to bottom - literally.

Keeping the script - and the website - fully functional is my highest priority.

h3.Features

Visit "re621.bitwolfy.com":https://re621.bitwolfy.com/ for a full feature overview.


h3. Installation
The project is delivered via a userscript. This means that you need a script manager, such as "Tampermonkey":https://tampermonkey.net.
Violentmonkey is also supported. Greasemonkey is not.

With a script manager installed, click on a release link, and follow the instructions in the new tab.

h3. Releases

h4. [ "Stable":https://github.com/re621/re621.Legacy/releases/latest/download/script.user.js ] (v.%LATEST_VERSION%)
h6. [ "Alternative":https://github.com/re621/re621.Legacy/releases/latest/download/altver.user.js | "Greasyfork":https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/408762 ]

The alternative version does not include features that require the script to be able to connect to domains not explicitly whitelisted in the header.
If you are security conscious, this version is for you.

The script is updated automatically whenever a new version is released, as long as that functionality is enabled in the extension settings.
You can manually update the script by left-clicking on the version number in the Tampermonkey dashboard.


h3. Updating
Note that re-installing the script by clicking the link in the Releases section will [b]wipe out your current settings[/b].
Instead, manually update the script by clicking the "tampermonkey icon":https://re621.bitwolfy.com/static/images/help/update-1.jpg in the toolbar, selecting "Dashboard":https://re621.bitwolfy.com/static/images/help/update-2.jpg, and then left-clicking on the "last update":https://re621.bitwolfy.com/static/images/help/update-3.jpg column for the script.
A new version will then be installed automatically.
It is also recommended that you "set the update interval to daily":https://re621.bitwolfy.com/static/images/help/update-4.jpg in the settings, so that you can receive all the latest changes and fixes as soon as they come out.
